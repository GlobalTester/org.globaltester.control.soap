	<h2>SOAP Interface</h2>

	<p>The SOAP implementation for remote control allows accessing
		GlobalTester features from local or remote clients for test
		environment integration purposes.</p>
	<p>
		A modular design is used for providing the wanted services. A generic
		service is available that allows to query what Services are available
		and on what URLs they can be reached. This service is published under
		a URL of the form
		<code>http://host:port/globaltester/RemoteControl.wsdl</code>
		using host and port as configured in the SOAP preferences. If you are
		using default settings, you can use this URL to access the WSDL file
		for this service on a currently running GlobalTester instance:
		<code>http://localhost:8888/globaltester/RemoteControl?wsdl</code>
		.
	</p>
	<p>The actually published services will be available using similar
		URLs. The "RemoteControl" part is exchanged with the published service
		name as retrieved from the generic service. Then the WSDL file can be
		retrieved exactly as the generic one.</p>
