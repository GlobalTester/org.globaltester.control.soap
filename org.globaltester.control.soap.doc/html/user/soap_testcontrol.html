	<h2>Remote test case execution</h2>

	<p>The remote control SOAP service consists of two different
		published endpoints. The SOAP endpoint for controlling the test
		execution in the GlobalTester presents the available methods and data
		types.</p>
	<p>
		To allow bidirectional communication, the callback must be available
		as a SOAP endpoint itself. The WSDL for this can be found at the URL
		<code>http://host:port/globaltester/DummyControl?wsdl</code> as described <a href="soap_reference.html">here</a>
	<p>
		For reference there are implementations in the
		<code>com.secunet.globaltester.testcontrol.soap.consumer</code>
		and
		<code>com.secunet.globaltester.testcontrol.callback.soap.provider
		</code>
		bundles.
