	<h2>Changing SOAP preferences</h2>
	<p>The SOAP preference page allows to set the ip and port to use
		when creating the control service. To be able to connect from the
		outside an explicit network interface needs to be defined here.
		Alternatively the wildcard IP address 0.0.0.0 can be used to listen on
		all interfaces for connections from the outside.</p>
	<p>To restart the SOAP service and application of the new settings
		a restart of the GlobalTester is required.</p>
